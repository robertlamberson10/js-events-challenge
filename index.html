        Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Is it my imagination,
        or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? We have a saboteur aboard. Flair is what marks
        the difference between artistry and mere competence. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your
        only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant?

        years to think about it.
